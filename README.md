The world has an incredibly growing population since its birth. More people means more consumption and of course massive hunger crises due to some mistakes made. But problems must always be rooted out, and the root of hunger corresponds to agriculture. According to the latest research we have done, although people try to do productive agriculture, they experience a yield loss of minimum 10% and maximum 100% per year because there is no exact recipe for it and they cannot observe the condition of their plants and soils with the naked eye. This is where geogra comes into play. 

First of all, Let me introduce "The Point". The "point" is a programable iot device which collects the instant moisture, mineral and vitamin values of the plant and soil, which cannot be observed with the naked eye, from the entire spreading area of your land, thanks to its sensors. But of course, raw knowledge of the amount of magnesium is of no use to anyone, 

at this point the "Main Hub" device takes its place on the stage. This device stores all the information collected from the "Point" device when necessary, and when it is not required, it stores it both in the "IBM Cloud" thanks to the 5G connection and translates it into sentences that can be understood by everyone, thanks to the artificial intelligence.

In there we have a dashboard which builded with IBM Cognos. This app is software as a service which has a four different sections. Which is the device tracking, statistics, database and functions section. Functions sections is where you can able to program the device. Thanks to that user will be able to reach app every place on earth

 In emergency situations which the user has decided, it sends notifications to your mobile devices Of course, your climate does not only belong to the region where your land is located, of course, a single climate covers thousands of hectares of land, so we make an analysis for you using not only the information from your "points" but also the information from the "points" in the surrounding lands. 

According to our road map our top priority is the make sure to build perfectly. And also This system will be monthly subscription and aproximatly will cost to user 6us dollar but it will depend on the size of the agriculture area
